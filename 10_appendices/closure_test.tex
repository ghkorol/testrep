\chapter{Closure Tests with Pseudo-data}\label{appendix:closT}

The cross section results derived with the pseudo-data are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:closT}. They are measured in bins 
of $p_{T}(t)$ and $|y(t)|$. The pseudo-data is generated according to the procedure described in sec. \ref{ssec:clT}.
The nominal $\MG+\PYTHIA$ $t\bar{t}$ signal distributions are plotted as references.

No biases between unfolded and original pseudo-data are observed.

         sample by reweighting it with the weights \ref{eq:clTw1} and parameters  $a_{1} = 0.0015$, $b_{1} = 0.8$ (top left), 
         with the weights \ref{eq:clTw1} and parameters  $a_{1} = -0.0015$, $b_{1} = 1.2$ (top right), with the weights \ref{eq:clTw2} and parameters 
         $a_{2} = 0.17$, $b_{2} = 0.7$ (bottom left) and with the weights \ref{eq:clTw2} and parameters  $a_{2} = -0.17$, $b_{2} = 1.3$ (bottom right).
         The nominal $t\bar{t}$ signal sample, which was used to calculate the migration matrix for the unfolding, is drawn with red line. The original
         pseudo-data is drawn with a dashed red line and the unfolded pseudo-data is marked with black points. The error bands correspond to the statistical
         uncertainty of the unfolded pseudo-data.}
