\chapter{Choice of the Kinematic Reconstruction Solution with the Smallest M($t\bar{t}$)}\label{appendix:mtt}

Only the solution of the kinematic equations \ref{alg:LS1}-\ref{alg:LS6} with minimal $m(t\bar{t})$ is taken for the further analysis.
Studies which show the advisability of this criterion were performed.

The studies were performed on the generated $t\bar{t}$ signal events. The correct solution of the kinematic equations was defined by comparing the 
solution neutrino momentum, $p_{\nu/\bar{\nu}}^{sol}$, to the generated one, $p_{\nu/\bar{\nu}}^{gen}$,  and choosing a solution with minimum $\chi^{2}$.
This $\chi^{2}$ is defined as follows \cite{Sonnenschein:2005ed}:

\begin{equation}
 \chi^{2} = (p_{\nu_{x}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{x}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\nu_{y}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{y}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\nu_{z}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{z}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\bar{\nu}_{x}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{x}}^{sol})^{2} +
 (p_{\bar{\nu}_{y}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{y}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\bar{\nu}_{z}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{z}}^{sol})^{2}.
\end{equation}

The fraction of correct solutions with minimal, second minimal, third minimal and fourth minimal invariant $t\bar{t}$ mass are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corrMinMtt}. In $60\%$ of 
the cases the correct solution has a minimal $m(t\bar{t})$. One might tend to average all the solutions to include always the correct solutions. However, the figures \ref{fig:Absvs}
show that the relative resolution\footnote{The relative resolution is defined as in appendix \ref{appendix:smear}.} for the average and weighted average\footnote{The average 
solution calculated using the formula \ref{eq:weigh_av}, if all the weights are all equal to 1, and the weighted average -- using the same formula, but taking the weights according 
to the order of the $m(t\bar{t})$ of the solution, or from the distribution \ref{fig:corrMinMtt}.} solutions are higher then the once
of the smallest $m(t\bar{t})$.

These studies show the advisability of selecting the
solution with the smallest $m(t\bar{t})$ for the further analysis.
