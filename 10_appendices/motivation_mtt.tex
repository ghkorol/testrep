\chapter{Kinematic Reconstruction Solution with the Smallest M($t\bar{t}$)}\label{appendix:mtt}

Only the solution of the kinematic equations \ref{alg:LS1}-\ref{alg:LS6} with minimal $m(t\bar{t})$ is taken for the further analysis.
Studies which show the advisability of this criterion were performed.

The studies were performed on the generated $t\bar{t}$ signal events. The correct solution of the kinematic equations was defined by comparing the 
solution neutrino momentum, $p_{\nu/\bar{\nu}}^{sol}$, to the generated one, $p_{\nu/\bar{\nu}}^{gen}$,  and choosing a solution with minimum $\chi^{2}$.
This $\chi^{2}$ is defined as follows \cite{Sonnenschein:2005ed}:

\begin{equation}
 \chi^{2} = (p_{\nu_{x}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{x}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\nu_{y}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{y}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\nu_{z}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{z}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\bar{\nu}_{x}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{x}}^{sol})^{2} +
 (p_{\bar{\nu}_{y}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{y}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\bar{\nu}_{z}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{z}}^{sol})^{2}.
\end{equation}

The fraction of correct solutions with minimal, second minimal, third minimal and fourth minimal invariant $t\bar{t}$ mass are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corrMinMtt}. In $60\%$ of 
the cases the correct solution has a minimal $m(t\bar{t})$. One might tend to average all the solutions to include always the correct solutions. However, the figures \ref{fig:Absvs}
show that the relative resolution\footnote{The relative resolution is defined as in appendix \ref{appendix:smear}.} for the average and weighted average\footnote{The average 
solution calculated  over the up to four solutions of the equations  \ref{alg:LS1}-\ref{alg:LS6} is determined as an arithmetic average for each component of the momenta of the 
solutions, and the weighted average is determined by averaging the solutions momenta components with the weights according to the order of the $m(t\bar{t})$ of the solution, 
or from the distribution in Fig. \ref{fig:corrMinMtt}. To complete the kinematics, the $t$ and $\bar{t}$ energies are calculated taking their average momenta and assuming the 
top mass $m(t) = m(\bar{t}) = $ 172.5 GeV.} solutions are worth then the one of the smallest $m(t\bar{t})$.

These studies show the advisability of selecting the
solution with the smallest $m(t\bar{t})$ for the further analysis.
