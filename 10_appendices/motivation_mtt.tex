\chapter{Choice of the Kinematic Reconstruction Solution with the Smallest M($t\bar{t}$)}\label{appendix:mtt}

Only the solution of the kinematic equations \ref{alg:LS1}-\ref{alg:LS6} with minimal $m(t\bar{t})$ is taken for the further analysis.
The studies which show the advisability of this criterion were performed.

The studies were performed on the generated events. The correct solution of the kinematic equations was defined by comparing the 
solution neutrino momentum $p_{\nu/\bar{\nu}}^{sol}$ to the generated one $p_{\nu/\bar{\nu}}^{gen}$ with the help of the $\chi^{2}$ criterion as following \cite{}:

\begin{equation}
 \chi^{2} = (p_{\nu_{x}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{x}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\nu_{y}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{y}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\nu_{z}}^{gen} - p_{\nu_{z}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\bar{\nu}_{x}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{x}}^{sol})^{2} +
 (p_{\bar{\nu}_{y}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{y}}^{sol})^{2} + (p_{\bar{\nu}_{z}}^{gen} - p_{\bar{\nu}_{z}}^{sol})^{2}.
\end{equation}
