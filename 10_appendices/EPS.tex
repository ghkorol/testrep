\chapter{Plots for Efficiencies, Purities and Stabilities}\label{appendix:EPS}

Efficiencies, purities and stabilities in bins of all the variables, in which the cross sections
are measured, are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_y_pt_ap} -- \ref{fig:EPS_2D_Mtt_x1}.

There are no outstanding biases observed. However, small tendencies are present. 

Fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_ptt_ytt} shows the efficiency, purity and stability in bins of $p_{T}(t\bar{t})$ and $|y(t\bar{t})|$. The efficiency
slightly increases towards the higher transverse momentum of top pairs and significantly grows towards the central rapidities of the $t\bar{t}$. It varies
between 20\% and 30\%. Purity
and stability have similar behavior and are higher for low $p_{T}(t\bar{t})$ and central rapidity bin. They vary between 40\% and almost 70\%.

The purities, stabilities and efficiencies in bins of $M(t\bar{t})$ and $|y(t)|$ are presented in fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_Mtt_yt}. The efficiencies get higher with the 
growth of the $M(t\bar{t})$ and are always lower for the high rapidities of the top-quark. The efficiency in general alters around 30\%. Purity and stabilities
do not vary much between the different bins of the $M(t\bar{t})$ and are higher for the most central rapidity bin.

The efficiency-purity-stability plot is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_Mtt_pt}. The efficiencies grow with increasing $p_{T}(t)$ and the slope is higher with
the higher $M(t\bar{t})$. Purities and stabilities alter from 20\% to 50 \%.

Fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_Mtt_phi} shows efficiencies, purities and stabilities in bins of these variables. This figure shows that purities and stabilities grow with the 
increase of the $\Delta\phi(t\bar{t})$. The efficiencies show the same tendency, except for the lowest invariant mass bin. There efficiencies decrease while $\Delta\phi(t\bar{t})$
increases.

The efficiency, purity and stability for each bin of rapidity and invariant mass of the top pair are presented in fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_ytt_Mtt}. This plot
shows that the efficiencies are slightly larger for larger masses of the top pairs and more central $|y(t\bar{t})|$. The purity is decreasing with the
growth of $M(t\bar{t})$. In general, purities and stabilities have similar behavior versus $M(t\bar{t})$ and $|y(t\bar{t})|$ and vary between 40\% and 60\%.

Fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_pttt_Mtt} shows efficiencies, purities and stabilities in each bin of $|p_{T}(t\bar{t})|$ and $M(t\bar{t})$. Efficiency increases 
in both, mass and transverse momentum of the $t\bar{t}$ system indicating that the quality of reconstruction for the system with higher energy is better.
Purities and stabilities increase with transverse momentum of top pair system, not taking to account the lowest $p_{T}(t\bar{t})$ bin, which for all 
bins of $M(t\bar{t})$ shows significantly higher purities and stabilities.
% 
% The quality of the events in each bin of $p_{T}(t\bar{t})$ and  $x_{1}$ are represented with efficiencies, purities and stabilities shown in fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_ptt_x1}.
% This plot shows that efficiencies, purities and stabilities increase with $p_{T}(t\bar{t})$. Additionally, purities and stabilities constantly decrease with 
% increasing  $x_{1}$. Efficiencies start to decrease starting from the middle $x_{1}$ bin. The lowest bin in  $x_{1}$ has the lowest efficiencies
% (with minimum less than 10\%) purities (down to 15\%) and stabilities (down to 20\%).

Fig. \ref{fig:EPS_2D_Mtt_x1} shows that the efficiencies, purities and stabilities are getting lower the higher $x_{1}$ gets. The dependence on $M(t\bar{t})$
is the opposite -- efficiencies, purities and stabilities grow with $M(t\bar{t})$.
