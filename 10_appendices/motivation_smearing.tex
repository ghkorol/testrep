\chapter{Smearing of the Measured Objects}\label{appendix:smear}

As a part of the actions performed for the $t\bar{t}$ kinematic reconstruction, each jet and lepton energy 
and momentum direction is smeared 100 times to have more points where the kinematic equations \ref{alg:LS1}-\ref{alg:LS6} 
are solvable. This means the efficiency of the kinematic reconstruction should increase due to this procedure.
Indeed, the figure \ref{fig:SmearEff} shows that the efficiency applying smearing is higher. However one should also test the
quality of the solutions which are taken from the smeared points.

The figure \ref{fig:RMSsmear} shows the relative resolution of the solutions which appear only because of smearing compared to the one of the
solutions from the central measured values and all smeared solutions. It appears that the resolution of the solutions
which were yielded due to the smearing procedure have slightly better resolution. This fact is resulted by the topology of these 
events, which have higher jet multiplicity (fig.\ref{fig:multSmear}). An event with more jets has more possible combinations of leptons-jet pairs. This
increases the combinatorics problem effect.

  event even without smearing (red) and all smeared solutions (green). The resolution of the solutions from the events
  where no smearing is applied is marked with orange.}
