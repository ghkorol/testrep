% A measurement of charm and beauty production in Deep Inelastic Scattering at HERA is presented.
% The analysis is based on the data sample collected by the ZEUS detector in the period from 2003 to 2007 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \SI{354}{\per\pico\barn}.
% The kinematic region of the measurement is given by $\num{5}<\Qsq<\SI{1000}{\GeV\squared}$ and $0.02<y<0.7$,
% where $Q^2$ is the photon virtuality and $y$ is the inelasticity.
% A lifetime technique is used to tag the production of charm and beauty quarks.
% Secondary vertices due to decays of charm and beauty hadrons are reconstructed, in association with jets.
% The jet kinematics is defined by $\ETjet>\SI{4.2(5)}{\GeV}$ for charm (beauty) and $-1.6<\etajet<2.2$ for both charm and beauty,
% where \ETjet and \etajet are the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the jet, respectively.
% The significance of the decay length and the invariant mass of charged tracks associated with the secondary vertex are used as discriminating variables to distinguish between signal and background.
% Differential cross sections of jet production in charm and beauty events as a function of \Qsq, $y$, \ETjet and \etajet are measured.
% Results are compared to Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) predictions from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the fixed flavour number scheme.
% Good agreement between  data and theory is observed.
% Contributions of the charm and beauty production to the inclusive proton structure function, \Ftwoc and \Ftwob,
% are determined by extrapolating the double differential cross sections using NLO QCD predictions.
% 
% \noindent
% Contributions to the test beam program for the Insertable B-Layer upgrade project of the ATLAS pixel detector are discussed. 
% The test beam data analysis software package EUTelescope was extended, which allowed an efficient analysis of ATLAS pixel sensors.
% The USBPix DAQ system was integrated into the EUDET telescope allowing test beam measurements with the front end chip FE-I4.
% Planar and 3D ATLAS pixel sensors were studied at the first IBL test beam at the CERN SPS.
